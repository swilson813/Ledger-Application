# Accounting Ledger Application

### This is my Capstone1

This application is an accounting application that securely allows users to track and filter 
through their financial activity. This would include payment and deposits.

Interesting code:
This code is interesting bc it mentally challenged me. And I thought it was cool to learn the code that apps we use everyday keep up with our transactions.

## Future work:
