# Accounting Ledger Application

### This is my Capstone1

This project is an accounting ledger application that uses a ledger to track financial dates, time, description, amount and vendors
entries. This application also makes it possible to input new payments and deposits.

Interesting code:
This code is interesting bc it mentally challenged me. And I thought it was cool to learn the code that apps we use everyday keep up with our transactions.

Future work: The ability to show pending deposit (so you don't have to question whether your payment went through or not)
